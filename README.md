The Electoral College is effectively a way to weight votes for president
========================================================================

The Electoral College is equivalent to everyone directly voting for president
but their votes are weighted by their state and how the plurality of their
state voted. When the plurality of a state votes for a different candidate,
the voter's vote has a weight of 0. If they vote for the state's winner,
their vote is weighted by the state's number of electoral votes divided by
the number of votes for the winning candidate. The same applies to congressional
districts for Maine and Nebraska, where some electors are selected by
congressional district instead of state, as well as the District of Columbia.
In this analysis, I am ignoring faithless electors, which have not affected
the outcome of an election.

While the Electoral College gives different candidates advantages over
the unweighted popular vote, which party it advantages can change from election
to election. The primary effect of the Electoral college, in all elections,
is to disenfranchise voters in states where their candidate loses locally.
Republicans in California and Democrats in Texas are effectively disenfranchised
in presidential elections because of the Electoral College. A second effect is
that the votes of people in less populous states and states with lower voter
participation are given greater weight.
